# Library Management System

Extending the base system(https://github.com/prabhakar267/library-management-system):

Fixes Done so Far:
- Admin login
  - students-for-approval, all-student-registered -> Added option for filtering "All Branch"
  - students-for-approval, all-student-registered -> JS fixes, as JSON object load issue
  - all-books -> Added "All Books" Filter


- To Do
  - "Edit/Delete Books" option is missing, should have been added under Admin -> all-books
  - Pagination under all-books
  - Issue a New Book - Too Cumbersome as it expects user ID and Book ID
  - Return a Book - Too cumborsome as it expects book ID
  - Admin -> Dashboard-> Find Book Issue, will have to be changed to "Check Book Availability"
